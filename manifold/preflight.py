"""Preflight guards: fail clearly on missing or unresolved LFS artifacts.

The checkpoint and the 963 MB ARCHS4 memmap are Git LFS objects in the Bridge
RNA repository. On a fresh checkout they can arrive as ~130-byte text stubs
rather than the real binary, and every downstream failure would then be
mysterious. These guards turn that into one legible error at startup.

Only the precompute scripts touch those LFS objects. The serving app reads its
own cache and nothing else, which is why the two required-artifact lists have
no overlap.
