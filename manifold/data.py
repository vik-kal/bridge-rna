"""Artifact loaders with module-level caches.

The serving app loads only small precomputed artifacts: coordinate parquets, the
identity table, the OSDR label table, the ARCHS4 GEO metadata join, and the
build record that says how the coordinates were fit.
Nothing here imports torch or umap, and nothing here opens the 963 MB ARCHS4
embedding memmap - the map draws precomputed coordinates, so it never needs a
512-d vector at request time. The retrieval half does open that memmap, on
every cached search; this module is not on that path.

`projection_stats.json` is read here, but only as a build *record* - never for
coordinates. It was dropped from this module once, when the density raster that
placed itself at the recorded extent was removed and nothing else needed the
file. The projection-parameter readout on the control rail brought it back: the
rail states the settings that produced the coordinates on screen, and that
answer has to come from what the build actually wrote rather than from constants
duplicated in the serving code, which is how a rail ends up confidently
describing a build it is not showing.

Global point order is fixed as [ARCHS4 (0..N_ARCHS4-1), then OSDR
(N_ARCHS4..N-1)], matching build_projections.py. A point index `i` addresses
the same sample across every artifact.
