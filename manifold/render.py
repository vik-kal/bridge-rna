"""Figure construction: layered WebGL scatter.

Layers, back to front:
  1. ARCHS4 background - a WebGL sample of the 940,455-point corpus, split into
     categorical traces by the selected field.
  2. OSDR overlay - all OSDR points, larger diamonds with a white ring, always
     on top so the 2,108 spaceflight samples stay findable in 940k.

There used to be a third layer underneath both: a precomputed density raster of
all 942,563 points, placed as a layout image. It is gone. Everything drawn here
is now a real glyph at a real sample's coordinates, which is why the point
budget goes all the way to the whole corpus.

Two decisions here are what keep the map honest.

*One palette for both corpora.* Categories are ranked once over the whole
covered population and every layer draws from that single mapping, so a liver in
GEO and a liver in OSDR are the same color. Ranking per layer - the previous
behaviour - silently gave the same category two different colors whenever the
two corpora had different category orderings, which is a legend that lies.

*A corpus a field does not describe is drawn as context, not as data.* Picking
a field that says nothing about ARCHS4 used to paint 940,455 uniform grey
glyphs, which reads as "ARCHS4 was measured and has no structure here". Instead
those points are drawn in one deliberately faint context color at 0.35 opacity,
outside the legend, so they read as scenery rather than as a category. The nine
OSDR-only fields that first raised this are gone; the branch is still reached,
by Tissue on a machine that never fetched the optional GEO join, which is the
state a fresh clone starts in. See manifold/colorby.py.

    0..n_archs4-1. No lookup, no join.

    a *hit* is carried by ring shape, never by hue. That split is measured, not

    retrieved by both cohorts receives both traces and therefore draws as a
    ring inscribed in a square, so the shared set is emergent rather than
    computed and cannot disagree with the number the status banner quotes.

    Every mark this function draws is keyed on screen by
