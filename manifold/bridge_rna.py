"""The single seam between the map half and the retrieval half.

The map reuses the retrieval half's model, preprocessing, and digest gate rather
than reimplementing them, because a subtle preprocessing drift produces
embeddings that look valid but are scientifically wrong. All imports from the
sibling repository are funnelled through this one module so the coupling is
visible and testable in isolation.

The two scripts that need these symbols (``precompute/embed_osdr.py`` and the
LFS preflight) import from here; the serving app never touches torch.
