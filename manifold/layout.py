# OSDR sample, that a white ring is a retrieved hit, that a round ring and a
# square ring are two different cohorts, that a ring inside a square is a hit
# both of them found - was either prose on a rail 800 px from the glyph it
# described, or nothing at all. A viewer who did not already know the scheme
# could only decode the picture by hovering it one point at a time.
#
# The hues below are read from `theme`, never mirrored into the stylesheet, so
# a change to RETRIEVAL_QUERY moves the plot and the key together. The
# stylesheet owns the *shapes*, because a shape has no Python constant to drift
# from - and the white it draws the hit rings in is the same white for the same
# measured reason (theme.RETRIEVAL_HIT_RING: no hue clears 3:1 against the worst
# categorical bucket on the navy canvas).
