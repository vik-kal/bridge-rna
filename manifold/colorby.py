"""The color-by registry: one place that knows what can be colored, and how much.

Before this module the renderer branched on the color-by key with a chain of
if/elif, and every branch decided for itself what to do about the corpus it did
not describe. The result was the failure this redesign exists to remove: pick
any OSDR field and 940,455 of 942,563 points - 99.8% of the map - became one
flat grey cloud, indistinguishable from "ARCHS4 has no structure here".

The fix is to make coverage a first-class, declared property. Every color-by is
a `ColorBy` that reports which corpora it can actually color *right now*, given
which artifacts exist on this machine. That single fact drives everything
downstream:

  * the menu groups whole-map fields above spaceflight-only ones,
  * an option with no data at all is offered but disabled, with the command to
    run attached, instead of silently missing or silently grey,
  * the control rail states the exact point count a field colors, and
  * the renderer never paints a uniform grey glyph cloud: a corpus a field does
    not describe is drawn as *context*, in one faint color with no legend row,
    which shows the real manifold shape instead of impersonating data.

`labels()` returns one array over the full corpus in fixed global order, with
`NOT_COVERED` marking points the field does not describe. Everything else is a
plain categorical render.
