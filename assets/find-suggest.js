/* Keyboard, pointer and open/closed behaviour for the "Find a study" combobox.
 *
 * This is the map's only JavaScript, and it exists because Dash cannot express
 * the one thing an autocomplete is made of: a keystroke. `dcc.Input` publishes
 * `value`, `n_submit` and `n_blur`, and none of those is Up, Down or Escape.
 * Everything that *can* be done in Python is: the server decides what the
 * suggestions are and what selecting one does, and this file never invents a
 * suggestion, never resolves an identifier, and never writes into a store.
 *
 * The division of labour is the design, and it is what keeps the two halves
 * from fighting over one property:
 *
 *   the server owns WHAT IS IN the list  - `offer_suggestions` renders the rows
 *   this file owns WHETHER IT IS OPEN    - one class, `is-closed`, on the group
 *
 * Those are independent facts with one owner each, and `map.css` composes them
 * into a single `display`: a list with no rows is hidden by `:empty`, and an
 * open list the reader has dismissed is hidden by the class. No callback writes
 * a `style` here, and this file never removes a row.
 *
 * Selection goes through Dash, not around it. A row is a real component with a
 * pattern-matching id, so a mouse click, a tap and Enter all end in the same
 * `n_clicks` and the same server callback - Enter is implemented as
 * `activeRow.click()` for exactly that reason. Nothing here pokes a value into
 * the input: React would not see it, and there would be two ways to commit a
 * search that could drift apart.
