# Cohort retrieval: querying with an experimental group

**Status: built, measured on the real corpus, and tested, 2026-08-05.**
**Amended 2026-08-06:** the confidence readout this document put on the rail is now measured per query and reported on the right; `docs/live_stability.md` is the current design, and the passages it supersedes are marked in place rather than rewritten.
This is the implementation document for the feature `docs/cohort_pooling.md` specified and measured.
That document is the prior evidence; this one is the build, and it carries its own measurements.
Every number below was produced by `precompute/validate_cohorts.py` against the real 963 MB ARCHS4 memmap and the real 2,108 cached OSDR embeddings, over **all 212 cohorts**, not a sample of them.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Cohorts under the default definition | **212** with two or more samples, across 70 studies (215 including 3 singletons) |
| Size | median 10, mean 9.9, max 38; 2,105 of 2,108 samples grouped |
| Pooled top-5 leave-one-out stability | **0.738**, against **0.161** for one sample: a **4.6x** gain |
| Against a structure-free null | 0.331, so the cohort definition is worth **+0.407** |
| Against a within-study null | 0.683, so tissue and arm are worth **+0.055** on top of the study |
| Cost of a pooled query | one memmap pass at any k. Since 2026-08-06 that pass also measures the result's stability, so it carries `2k+1` query vectors: 0.44 s for the pooled query alone, 1.00 s at the 38-animal maximum |
| Tests | 55 unit tests, 146 browser checks, 6 corpus-scale validation checks |

## Why this exists, in one paragraph

The Retrieve view answers for one OSDR sample at a time, and a single-sample top-5 is not a stable measurement.
Two replicates from the same cage share on average **0.13** of their top-5 ARCHS4 hits, and in every cohort tested there is a pair whose top-5 lists share nothing at all.
The cause is a scale mismatch rather than an outlier problem: the entire top-500 of a 940,455-sample index spans a cosine range comparable to the gap between two animals in the same cage, so the ordering of the result list is decided below the noise floor of the biology.
Pooling the cohort raises leave-one-out top-5 agreement from 0.13 to **0.78**, a six-fold gain.
That is the case for this feature, and it is a different case from the one that motivated it.

## 1. What a cohort is

### The default

A cohort is a set of OSDR samples that share a **study**, a **tissue**, and a **spaceflight arm**.
This is the ISA-Tab factor grouping OSDR already curates, so the tool is reading a grouping that exists rather than inventing one.
Measured on the shipped metadata: **215 cohorts across 70 studies**, median size 9, mean 9.8, max 38, and 2,095 of the 2,108 embedded samples live in one.

The arm is the **raw** OSDR value, not the binary Flight-vs-Ground collapse.
`manifold/data._flight_status` already records why: a basal animal was sacrificed at experiment start and a vivarium animal never entered flight hardware, so the seven control arms are not interchangeable.
Pooling a Vivarium Control with a Basal Control would average two different experiments and call the result one group.

### Why study is pinned and cannot be unticked

Random samples drawn from the same *study* already reach mean pairwise cosine 0.9805, against 0.9933 for a real cohort and 0.8826 for random OSDR samples.
Same-study membership therefore supplies **84%** of what makes a cohort coherent, and most of that is batch rather than biology.
Pooling *across* studies would average across the strongest batch boundary in the corpus, so study is a fixed facet.
The UI shows it as a pinned chip that cannot be removed, with the reason on hover, rather than hiding it.

### What the user controls

Three facets are available, drawn from `cache/osdr_metadata.parquet`, which is exactly the table of the 2,108 samples that have a cached embedding.

| facet | default | note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Study | **pinned on** | cannot be removed, for the reason above |
| Tissue | on | |
| Spaceflight arm | on | raw arm, seven values |

Unticking one merges cohorts and makes them larger: dropping Tissue pools a study's organs, dropping Spaceflight arm pools its flight animals with its controls.
The cohort count and the size distribution update live under the chips.

**Six further facets were offered and were removed on 2026-08-05: sex, strain, genotype, habitat, mission duration, diet.**
They came from the same parquet and cost nothing to offer, which is exactly why they were there, and that turned out to be the wrong reason.
Every one of them could only ever *split* a cohort, and the measured stability curve in section 3 is a function of size: a cohort of 10 reads 0.81 and a cohort of 3 reads 0.51.
So the six controls did nothing but trade away the quantity this whole feature exists to buy, in exchange for a contrast the two-arm comparison in section 4 answers directly and attributably.
They also made the *default* harder to read, because nine chips of which six are off looks like a definition you are expected to tune rather than the curated grouping OSDR already publishes.
The columns are still in the parquet, still resolved by the map's color-by registry, and re-adding one is a single line in `bridge_rna/cohorts.FACETS`; nothing else in the app hard-codes a facet.

A fourth control sits below the cohort picker: the **member list**, where any individual sample can be excluded from the pool.
Nothing is ever auto-excluded.

## 2. The estimator

```python
def cohort_query_vector(rows: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Spherical (von Mises-Fisher) mean of a cohort's cached embeddings."""
    u = rows / np.linalg.norm(rows, axis=1, keepdims=True)   # one animal, one vote
    m = u.mean(axis=0)
    return m / np.linalg.norm(m)
```

Each member is L2-normalized **before** averaging.
Without that, `cos(mean, x)` is the members' cosines weighted by their L2 norms, and invariant 2 establishes that the norm is a transcriptome-concentration axis spanning 3.9x across the corpus, so the most concentrated transcriptomes would cast the loudest votes for no stated reason.
Within a real cohort the spread is only 1.09x and the two estimators agree to a median cosine of 0.9999994, so this changes almost nothing today.
It is done anyway because it is the maximum-likelihood estimator for data compared by cosine, and because it stays correct if anyone ever unticks Tissue and pools across organs, where the 3.9x spread is real.

Two statistics fall out of the same `u`, and both are shown:

- **Each member's cosine to the leave-one-out centroid.** This is the correct outlier statistic. Using the full centroid instead lets an outlier pull the reference towards itself and hide inside it.
- **Expected top-5 stability given k**, read off the measured curve in `precompute/validate_cohorts.py`. *This second one was replaced on 2026-08-06 by the same statistic measured on the query that just ran, at the depth on screen; see section 3 and `docs/live_stability.md`. It is no longer a function of the cohort's size, because it is no longer an estimate.*

A third was shown and **was removed on 2026-08-05**: `R̄ = |u.mean(axis=0)|`, the vMF resultant length, labelled "Group tightness" on the card.
It is a real statistic and it is measured in `docs/cohort_pooling.md`, but as a readout it was inert.
Across all 212 real cohorts its median is **0.9991**, and it is no lower for a cohort of two than for one of thirty, so it never separated a group worth trusting from one that was not.
A number that is always within a thousandth of its maximum, sitting on a card beside a number that genuinely varies, is read as a grade rather than as a constant, which is the opposite of what it says.
The per-member leave-one-out cosine stays, because that one does vary within a cohort and names an individual animal a user can act on.

The medoid was measured and rejected: it agrees with the centroid on only 0.46 of the top-5, and being one sample it inherits exactly the single-sample instability the feature exists to remove.

## 3. Low N, and what the interface says about it

> **Superseded in part on 2026-08-06.** The stability figure this section put on the rail's cohort card is gone; it is measured per query and reported on the right after the search instead. `docs/live_stability.md` is the current design and carries the reason. What survives here is the size treatment in the picker, which is the one thing that can honestly be said before a search has run.

A cohort of two is still a cohort, and it is still better than one sample.
It is not as good as a cohort of nine, and the picker has to say so without either hiding the result or crying wolf.

Three states, and the threshold comes from the measured stability-versus-k curve rather than from taste:

| k | state | treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | not a cohort | disabled in the picker, reason shown: pooling needs at least two samples |
| 2 to 4 | low N | selectable and searchable, marked "low N" in the picker's option label |
| 5 and up | normal | no mark |

That is a statement about **size**, made in the one place where size is all that is known.
The card underneath states the size and nothing else.

The amber flag moved with the number: it now fires on the *measured* stability falling under `STABILITY_FLOOR`, which is the same 0.70 that picked `LOW_N_THRESHOLD`, and it appears in the stability panel beside the number that triggered it.
Amber rather than red, for the same reason the map's coverage bar is amber: a result that moves when you drop an animal is reporting correctly, not failing.

### The curve, and why it is bucketed

Measured leave-one-out top-5 agreement, over all 212 cohorts:

| k | cohorts | stability | sd |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 5 | 0.34 | 0.20 |
| 3 | 22 | 0.51 | 0.27 |
| 4 | 8 | 0.55 | 0.17 |
| 5-9 | 70 | 0.72 | 0.18 |
| 10-14 | 70 | 0.81 | 0.12 |
| 15+ | 37 | 0.86 | 0.11 |

`LOW_N_THRESHOLD` is 5 because k >= 5 is the first bucket to reach 0.70.
It is one constant in `bridge_rna/cohorts.py` carrying the measurement in its comment, so it cannot drift from the evidence, and `validate_cohorts.py` check 5 exits non-zero if a full sweep moves the knee away from it.

**This curve set that threshold and no longer does anything else.**
It was `cohorts.STABILITY_BY_K` until 2026-08-06, quoted on the card, and the sd column above is why it could not stay there: at 0.18 within the 5-9 bucket, "0.72" covers real cohorts measuring 0.316 and 0.849.
A population average printed beside one cohort's name is read as a property of that cohort.

Two things about this table were corrections rather than choices, and both are worth keeping.

**The first sweep quoted per-size figures and they were noise.** Sampling two cohorts per size produced 0.38 at k=5 sitting beside 0.90 at k=6, which is a fact about which two cohorts were drawn and not about size. A number quoted in the interface has to stand on enough cohorts that it does not swing by half its range when the seed changes, so sizes are pooled into buckets and each bucket reports its count and its spread.

**Adjacent buckets inverted, and merging them is the honest repair.** Even over all 212 cohorts, 5-6 scored 0.736 and 7-9 scored 0.696, an inversion of 0.04 against a within-bucket sd of 0.18. A larger cohort must never be reported as less trustworthy than a smaller one, so `validate_cohorts.py` merges adjacent buckets that invert before printing the curve, which is what produced the 5-9 row. Clamping the number instead would have invented monotonicity; shipping the raw pair would have told a researcher their seven-animal cohort was worse than a five-animal one. The unit test that pinned the shipped curve monotone went with the curve on 2026-08-06; `validate_cohorts.py` still does the merging, and what it now gates is that the knee still lands on `LOW_N_THRESHOLD`.

## 4. Two arms, run as two queries

An optional **compare against** picker runs a sibling cohort as a second, independent pooled query, and draws both on one network.
The number it produces is the **overlap between the two hit sets**, which answers a real question: do this study's flight animals and its ground controls land in the same part of Earth's transcriptome space, or different parts?

What it deliberately is **not** is the difference vector `centroid(flight) - centroid(ground)`.
That is the standard differential-expression move and it does not belong here for two reasons.
A difference of two unit vectors is not a transcriptome, so cosine-ranking ARCHS4 against it asks which GEO sample's *absolute* profile most resembles a *change*, which is a category error against an index that holds profiles.
And the corpus-level version was already built, measured and rejected: the flight-minus-ground axis correlated r = -0.990 with PC1, which is the transcriptome-concentration axis, and one in ten random flight/ground relabelings beat it on spatial structure.

## 5. Where the code goes

### A fifth query-vector source, not a new pipeline

The cosine scan, `_annotate_from_cache`, and the `archs4_index` map join are the cached path's, reused unchanged, exactly as file ingestion reuses them.
So a cohort hit carries the same schema as a single-sample hit, and everything downstream of the hits frame keeps working without knowing a cohort produced it.

```python
def run_cohort_retrieval(sample_ids, topk):
    rows = np.stack([cached_query_vector(s) for s in sample_ids])
    # Row 0 answers the query; the rest exist only to measure how far it
    # survives dropping one member, and are scored in the same pass.
    q_mat = np.concatenate([cohort_query_vector(rows).reshape(1, -1),
                            leave_one_out_vectors(rows), rows])
    idx, score = _topk_cosine_matrix(index_vecs=..., q_mat=q_mat, k=topk)
    hits = _annotate_from_cache(idx[0], score[0])
    hits["archs4_index"] = idx[0].astype(int)
    return hits, rows, measure_stability(sample_ids, idx[0], ..., depth=topk)
```

No model, no subprocess, no torch and no new artifact, and still **one** memmap scan whatever the cohort size.
The scan carries `2k+1` query vectors rather than one since 2026-08-06, which is what makes result stability a measurement instead of a lookup: 0.44 s for the pooled query alone, 0.50 s at the median cohort size of 10, and 1.00 s for the 77 vectors a 38-animal cohort needs.
`docs/live_stability.md` section 4 has the full table and the reason the extra queries are nearly free.

| file | change |
| --- | --- |
| `bridge_rna/cohorts.py` | **new.** Facet registry, cohort construction, geometry, low-N tiering. The only file that knows what a cohort is. |
| `bridge_rna/retrieval.py` | `run_cohort_retrieval`, mode `"cohort"` |
| `bridge_rna/callbacks.py` | a `"cohort"` entry in `_retrieval_phrase`, the mode switch, the cohort callbacks, a synthesized cohort query row |
| `bridge_rna/layout.py` | the segmented Sample / Cohort / Upload switch and the cohort panel |
| `bridge_rna/panels.py` | the cohort inspector: membership, per-member LOO cosine, the overlap readout |
| `bridge_rna/figures.py` | a pooled query node, and a two-query network for the compare case |
| `manifold/callbacks.py` | `_retrieval_overlay` draws every pooled member on the map, not one |
| `precompute/validate_cohorts.py` | **new.** The honesty gate. |

`bridge_rna/cohorts.py` is a separate module rather than more of `retrieval.py` because it depends on no embedding and no memmap at all.
It is pure metadata grouping plus 512-d arithmetic, it can be tested against the fixture corpus without either artifact, and keeping it apart is what stops `retrieval.py` from growing a second responsibility.

### The status banner

`_retrieval_phrase("cohort")` must name the path, as it must for every mode.
The invariant this repo already broke once, when every cached result was announced as demo-script output, is that the interface always says which path answered.
A pooled result must never be labelled with one member's name; the query node carries the cohort's name and its size.

## 6. How we know it works

`precompute/validate_cohorts.py`, run against the real 963 MB memmap, and mirroring how every other candidate in this repo was accepted or rejected.
It computes every query vector it needs up front and streams the memmap **once**, keeping a running top-k per query, which is the same technique `validate_artifacts.py --mixing` uses and the reason hundreds of queries cost one pass rather than hundreds.

Six checks, all passing as of 2026-08-05.
The whole run is 9,270 query vectors scored in a single 73-second pass over the memmap.

**1. Identity, and what it taught.**
A pooled query over one sample must reproduce that sample's cached-path result, or the pooling code is not sitting on the path it claims to reuse.

The first version demanded an identical top-100 and **failed**, and the reason turned out to be worth more than the check.
Pooling one sample normalizes it twice, once inside `cohort_query_vector` and once inside the scan, so the query vector differs from the plain one by **7.45e-9**, a single float32 ulp, at cosine 1.0.
Scores then differ by at most **1.19e-7**, which is float32 epsilon at magnitude 1.
That is enough to reorder the list: the first differing rank is 23, and the score gap between rank 23 and rank 24 there is **exactly 0.0**.
The two runs are permuting an exact tie rather than disagreeing, and through rank 50 they are still the same set.

So the gate is that scores agree to float32 and the depth a user actually reads is identical in order, and the measured divergence depth is printed rather than hidden.
Demanding more would be demanding that float32 have more precision than it has, and it would be the same over-reading of a hairline score gap that this whole feature exists to stop.
*Correctness: a failure exits non-zero.*

**2. Leave-one-out stability.**
Full-cohort top-k against each leave-one-out top-k, versus member-against-member:

| depth | pooled | member vs member | gain |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| top-5 | **0.738** | 0.161 | 4.6x |
| top-20 | 0.778 | 0.214 | 3.6x |
| top-100 | 0.826 | 0.302 | 2.7x |

**3. A structure-free null.**
k random OSDR samples pooled score **0.331**, so a real cohort beats an arbitrary group of the same size by **+0.407**.
Pooling is not merely averaging, and the cohort definition is doing most of the work.
*Correctness: a failure exits non-zero.*

**4. A within-study null.**
k random samples drawn from the cohort's own study, ignoring tissue and arm, score **0.683**.
So tissue and arm together are worth **+0.055** on top of what same-study membership already supplies.

This is the uncomfortable number, and it is the one to quote honestly rather than bury.
It is consistent with the earlier finding that study alone closes 84% of the distance to a real cohort.
It does not undermine the feature, since a pooled query is still 4.6x more stable than a single sample and that is the claim the interface makes.
It does mean a pooled result is a cleaner measurement of "this study's samples" than of "this biology", and the docs say so rather than letting the gain be read as purely biological.

**5. Stability versus k.**
The bucketed curve in section 3, which sets `LOW_N_THRESHOLD` and nothing else since 2026-08-06.
The check now compares the measured knee against the shipped threshold and fails on a mismatch, but only on a full sweep: a `--cohorts` sample draws one or two cohorts per size, which is the regime that produced 0.38 at k=5 beside 0.90 at k=6 in the first run of this script.

**6. Normalization.**
Over all 212 cohorts, `cos(spherical mean, raw mean)` has median **0.9999995** and worst case **0.99951**, and the two agree on the exact top-5 in 112 of 212 cohorts.
Exactly as predicted: within one cohort the L2-norm spread is about 1.09x, so the weighting has almost nothing to bite on.
Spherical is kept because it becomes the correct estimator the moment anyone unticks Tissue and the corpus-wide 3.9x spread is real.

## 7. Interface

The left rail gets a segmented control at the top: **Sample / Cohort / Upload**.
Only one query source is visible at a time, so the rail gets *shorter* than the current stacked "Query sample" plus "Or upload a sample" arrangement rather than longer.
The canvas, the inspector, the AI hypothesis, the top-k slider and the map hand-off are all shared and unchanged, because a cohort is a query like any other.

Cohort mode, top to bottom:

1. **OSDR study** dropdown, the same one Sample mode uses.
2. **Group by**, a row of facet chips. Study is pinned. A line under it reports how many cohorts the current definition produces and their size range.
3. **Cohort** dropdown, listing this study's cohorts with size and confidence state. Singletons are disabled with the reason, matching how the sample picker treats an unretrievable sample.
4. **The cohort card**: k pooled, and since 2026-08-06 nothing else.
5. **Members**, a collapsed disclosure listing every sample with its leave-one-out cosine, each with a checkbox. Any member flagged as an outlier is marked, never removed.
6. **Compare against**, an optional sibling-cohort picker, empty by default.
7. **A second cohort card**, when one is armed. Added 2026-08-06.
8. **Search cohort**.

The right-hand inspector gained a **stability panel** above the details panel on 2026-08-06, populated after the search, carrying one block per pooled query.
It is not on the rail because it is a property of the result rather than of the selection, and it does not exist until the query runs.

The rail's existing rule still holds where it can: the fact that qualifies a control sits directly under that control.
The cohort-count line hangs under the facet chips, and each cohort's size sits under the picker that chose it.

Step 7 exists because a comparison runs **two** independent pooled queries and the rail described one of them.
That is not a symmetry argument. Stability is a property of each arm on its own, so an overlap of 0.25 between a 12-animal cohort measuring 0.86 and a 2-animal cohort measuring 0.31 means something quite different from the same 0.25 between two cohorts of twelve - and the number that decides how much of the overlap to believe was on screen for the first arm only, while the second got a color in the network figure and a mark on the map.
The stability panel splits along the same line, for the same reason.
It sits under "Compare against" rather than beside the first card for the rule above, and because that ordering keeps the member ticks - which belong to cohort A alone - next to cohort A's card.
Both cards take a role line (`● COHORT A`, `● COHORT B · differs by spaceflight arm`) **only when there are two**; a lone cohort gets no letter, since there is nothing to tell it apart from.
The contrast facet is stated once, on the second card, because it is a property of the pair.

## 8. Testing

Three layers, each answering a question the others cannot.

**`tests/test_cohorts.py`, 55 tests, against the synthetic fixture corpus.**
Facet grouping, the estimator, leave-one-out cosines, low-N tiering, the pinned-study rule, and the sibling relation.
Two are worth calling out because they pin claims made in prose everywhere else.
`test_pooled_ranking_is_the_mean_of_the_members_own_cosines` checks the central algebraic claim directly: ranking by cosine to the spherical mean is identical to ranking by the unweighted average of the members' own cosines, which is what "ask every animal, then average the votes" means.
`test_one_animal_one_vote_regardless_of_transcriptome_concentration` scales one member's norm by 10 and asserts the pooled direction is unchanged, and then asserts that the *raw* mean would have been dragged, so the test cannot pass vacuously.

**`precompute/validate_cohorts.py`, 6 checks, against the real corpus.**
Section 6. This is the only layer that can speak to whether pooling works, as opposed to whether it computes what it says.

**`tests/e2e_cohort_check.py`, 146 browser checks, against the real app and the real cache.**
Define a cohort, retick facets, watch the count change, read the confidence card, open the member list, pool and search, open the inspector, exclude a member and watch every number restate, compare two arms, and follow the whole cohort to the map.
It asserts on what the page reports about itself, and two of its checks exist because this feature shipped those exact regressions and had them fixed: callbacks firing at page load so the canvas greeted a visitor with "Cohort retrieval failed", and the legend continuing to advertise a GSE column while a comparison that draws none was on screen.

**One trap, recorded because it cost a debugging cycle.**
The obvious wait predicates for a search - "the network has nodes", "the spinner is idle" - are both already true when a *second* search starts, so waiting on them returns instantly and the check then reads the previous result's banner.
The comparison step appeared to fail while the app was doing exactly the right thing.
`run_cohort_search` now waits for the status banner to change, and uses the spinner only as a secondary settle.

## 9. Both cohorts on the map

**Status: designed and built 2026-08-05.**

Until now a comparison was invisible on the map.
`_retrieval_overlay` read `member_ids` and `hits`, both of which describe cohort A only, and ignored `payload["comparison"]` entirely.
So a user who ran flight against ground and then walked to the map saw one arm, one set of hits, a badge reading "Showing retrieval: 5 hits", and a rail line naming cohort A - with nothing anywhere saying a second cohort had been retrieved and was not being drawn.

That is not a limitation, it is an omission, and the distinction matters because option A - keep it main-only and say so - would have cost the same UI work as fixing it.
The choice was between spending that work on a disclaimer and spending it on the answer.

### Why the map is the right place to settle a comparison

The comparison reports a **Jaccard overlap between two hit sets**, and section 4 states the question it stands for: do this study's flight animals and its ground controls land in the same part of Earth's transcriptome space?
Set overlap and spatial coincidence come apart in both directions, and this corpus makes that the common case rather than an edge case.
Two cohorts can share **zero** hits and sit in one tissue neighbourhood, each retrieving different GEO samples from the same crowd - Jaccard says 0.00 and the honest answer is "the same place, resolved finer than k=5".
The reverse happens too: an overlap of 0.4 where the shared hits are generic and each cohort's exclusive hits sit in different territories.
Neither reading is available from the network figure, which has no space in it.
Drawing both cohorts is the structure-free check on the headline number, which is how every other claim in this repo was accepted or rejected.

### Hue tells you the cohort; shape tells you who retrieved a hit

The obvious move - lift the comparison network's blue, warm and teal onto the map - was measured and is dead.
Against the worst of the eleven `CATEGORICAL` tissue hues on `PLOT_BG`, the network's cohort-A `#2b7fff` measures **1.03:1**, its cohort-B `#d9791b` **1.00:1**, and its shared `#0bab9f` **1.07:1**.
All three vanish over large tissue buckets.
That is the same measurement `manifold/theme.py` already records as the reason a hit ring is white at all: `#2b7fff` against `CATEGORICAL[0]` (the 155,761-point Blood / immune bucket, 16.6% of the corpus) is 1.03:1, and white is 3.64:1 against it and 16.9:1 against the background.
A two-cohort map can afford a lost hit even less than a one-cohort map, because a lost hit is now also a lost group assignment.

So the two channels are split by what each can carry:

| what | channel | A | B |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pooled member | **fill hue** | teal `RETRIEVAL_QUERY` | gold `RETRIEVAL_QUERY_B` |
| retrieved hit | **ring shape**, always white | `circle-open`, size 20 | `square-open`, size 27 |

Hue is safe on a member because a member is a *filled* mark with a 2 px white outline: its findability comes from the outline, so the fill only has to be discriminable from the other cohort's fill.
Gold `#ffc233` against teal `#0bab9f` measures CIEDE2000 **43.4** in normal vision and **31.7 / 45.0 / 48.0** under protanopia, deuteranopia and tritanopia, every one far above the 8.4 CVD bar the categorical palette was validated to.
It is 10.5:1 against `PLOT_BG` and 17.0 dE from the nearest categorical hue, so it cannot be read as a legend row.
`ACCENT_WARM #d9791b`, the network's own cohort-B color, was rejected for the map specifically: it sits 0.3 dE from `CATEGORICAL[3]` under deuteranopia.

Cohort A keeps teal deliberately.
A comparison is then the single-cohort case plus a second thing, rather than a new color scheme, so a single-sample map, a single-cohort map and the first arm of a comparison all draw the same mark.

**A shared hit is emergent, never computed.** It is in both hit lists, so it receives both traces: a 20 px ring inscribed in a 27 px square. There is no third symbol and no set intersection in the renderer, which means the shared set drawn on the map cannot drift from the `comparison["shared"]` the banner quotes, because it is not calculated twice.

`square-open` and `circle-open` are both in `Scatter3d`'s small symbol vocabulary, so the hit encoding is identical in 2-D and 3-D - which no hue scheme would have managed, since `star` is rejected outright in 3-D and already falls back to `diamond`.

### Three things this fixed on the way

**The halo scaled with membership and should not have.** Every query point got a 46 px ring at 0.50 alpha, so a 38-animal cohort composited into a teal disc - before any comparison existed. The star already shrank to 0.7x when pooled; the halo never got the same treatment. Alpha is now `0.50 / sqrt(k)` clamped to `[0.14, 0.50]` and the ring narrows to 32 px when pooled, so total halo ink stays roughly constant instead of growing with the cohort.

**The map-rank hover line was measured from an arbitrary animal.** It took `query_points[0]`, which for a cohort is whichever member happened to be first in metadata order, and for cohort B would have been a member of the wrong cohort entirely. Each hit is now ranked from **the nearest drawn member of the cohort that retrieved it**, and the hover says so.

**Rank numerals are dropped in a comparison.** Two competing numeral sets over the same few hundred pixels is illegible, and prefixing them is worse at 9 px. The hover carries strictly more: for a shared hit it names both cohorts, both 512-d ranks and both cosines.

### What the user controls

The map rail's "Show it on the map" checkbox becomes **one tick per cohort**, labelled with each cohort's own name, both on by default.
It is the same control rather than a new one, so nothing else about the rail changes, and unticking one is the escape hatch when two 38-member cohorts crowd the same region.

Framing follows the ticks, so "Frame the retrieval" frames what is actually drawn.

**Superseded on 2026-08-06.** A color key sat directly under those ticks, naming each cohort against a swatch and saying in prose that a ring inside a square is a hit both arms found.
It moved onto the plot, into the floating key, and the reason it moved is the reason this section gave for putting it on the rail: put the fact where the misreading happens, and the misreading happens at the glyph.
Two further things were wrong with it there.
The ticks immediately above already carry each cohort's name, so the rail named them twice; and the swatches keyed only the *member* hues, while the hits - which outnumber the members and are what a comparison is about - were encoded by a shape the rail never mentioned.
What is left on the rail is one line of the control's own feedback ("Both arms drawn, **10** hits, **2** of them retrieved by both").
`docs/map_key.md` is the design document for what replaced it.

### The cross-view color swap

`GRAPH_THEME` expressed the comparison network's A / B / shared language through keys named `gsm`, `gse` and `query`, which mean something else in `build_network_figure`, and it gave "retrieved by both" `#0bab9f` - the exact hex the map uses for the query.
Teal therefore meant "the query" in one view and "a shared hit" in the other, for the same search, and running a comparison silently recolored the query star that the search a minute earlier had drawn teal.

Two literals fix it: cohort A becomes teal and "retrieved by both" becomes blue.
Both views now agree that teal is cohort A and warm is cohort B, while each renders "both" the way its own canvas supports - a color on white, a doubled mark on navy.
`GRAPH_THEME` gains `cohort_a` / `cohort_b` / `cohort_shared` keys so the retrieval view names what it means.
