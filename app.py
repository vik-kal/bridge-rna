"""Bridge RNA - one app, two views.

    python app.py              # http://127.0.0.1:8050

`/` retrieves the closest Earth analogs for one NASA OSDR spaceflight sample.
`/map` draws all 942,563 points of the joint embedding space the retrieval
searched. They are two views of one instrument rather than two apps: a
retrieval's query and its hits are drawn in place on the map, and a point on
the map launches a retrieval, because the two halves address the same sample by
the same key and the same ARCHS4 hit by the same integer.

The retrieval half needs the model checkpoint and the 963 MB embedding memmap;
the map half needs only its precomputed cache. Neither is required for the
other to work, and the shell reports what is missing rather than failing.
