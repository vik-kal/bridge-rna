# 200 MB cap) per upload, forever, surviving process exit. A single looped E2E
# run left 32 files and 29 MB behind.
#
# Three bounds fix that without changing the flow: every staged file lives in
# one process-owned directory removed at exit, each session's previous file is
# unlinked when its next upload arrives, and a directory abandoned by a killed
# process is reaped by the next run. Steady state is one file per active
