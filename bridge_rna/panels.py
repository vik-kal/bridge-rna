    leave-one-out agreement against cohort size measured over all 212 cohorts.
    The number was real and the label was accurate, and it was still misleading
    where it sat: a population average printed beside one cohort's name is read
    as a property of *that* cohort, and the spread inside a size bucket is most
    of the range. Measured live, a cohort of 7 scoring 0.316 and a cohort of 6
    scoring 0.849 were both told 0.72.

    So stability moved to where it can be measured instead of predicted: it is
    computed during the search, over this cohort's own leave-one-out pools at
    the depth on screen, and it is reported by `build_stability_panel` on the
    right afterwards. A live number cannot sit under the picker, because it does
    not exist until the query runs - showing the previous cohort's figure there
    would be worse than the curve was. `docs/live_stability.md` has the
    evidence and the rejected alternatives.

    ``role`` names which arm of a comparison this is, and is empty when only one
    cohort is being pooled. When it is set the card gains a colored role line
    and the cohort's own name, because a comparison runs **two** pooled queries
    and describing only the selected one left the second with a color on two
