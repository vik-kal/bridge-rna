"""Retrieval: an OSDR query in, its nearest ARCHS4 analogs out.

Five paths produce a query vector and the app always reports which one ran,
because they differ in speed and in how much metadata comes back. The three
below are the ones `search_hits` chooses between for a single catalog sample,
tried in this order; the other two are chosen by the user rather than by
fallback - `run_uploaded_retrieval` for a file the corpus has never seen, and
`run_cohort_retrieval` for a whole experimental group pooled into one vector.
All five end in the same cosine scan.

1. **cached** - the manifold precompute already embedded all 2,108 eligible
   OSDR samples (`cache/osdr_sample_embeddings.float32.npy`), using a
   preprocessing path checked bit-for-bit against the single-sample path below
   (max abs diff 0.0). Looking the vector up costs nothing, so the whole query
   is one cosine pass over the memmap: **0.5 s**, against 22 s for the
   subprocess. Hits are annotated from `cache/archs4_metadata.parquet`, which
   carries GEO series, title, source name, characteristics, and the canonical
   tissue bucket for all 940,455 ARCHS4 samples - offline, with no NCBI call.
   Verified on OSD-100 eye sample Rep1_M23: identical top-5 accessions and
   identical scores to six decimal places against the subprocess path.
2. **precomputed** - an `osdr_query_embeddings.parquet` supplied out of band.
3. **demo** - shell out to `demo_osdr_top5.py`, which loads the checkpoint and
   embeds the sample from its counts matrix. The only path that works for a
   sample the manifold never embedded, and the slowest by a factor of 44.

The cosine scan itself is the same code in every case, so the three paths
differ only in where the 512-d query vector came from.

    That is the same relationship file ingestion has to the cached path, and it
    is why nothing downstream of the hits frame needs to know a cohort produced

    much of this list survives dropping one animal, and how much would one
    animal alone have agreed with another" for *this* cohort at *this* depth. It
    replaces a bucketed curve looked up by cohort size, which was a population
    average being printed beside one cohort's name; `docs/live_stability.md`
    carries the measured spread that motivated the change.

    Still **one memmap pass**, because all `2k+1` query vectors are built before
    the index is touched and scored together. Measured: 0.44 s for the pooled
