"""Pytest bootstrap: point the map at a synthetic corpus before import.

``manifold.paths`` resolves its constants at import time from ``BRIDGE_RNA_ROOT``
and ``MANIFOLD_CACHE_DIR``. Both are therefore set here, at conftest import,
which runs before any test module imports the package. The corpus is built once
per session into a temp directory and torn down with it, so the suite never
touches the real 963 MB memmap or the multi-hour embedding artifacts and can run
on a machine that has neither.

    This is the degraded state the coverage UI exists for, and it is the state a

    Pointing the path at a non-existent file is enough: every reader gates on
    ``.exists()``. The caches must be cleared on both sides of the patch, since
    they would otherwise carry the metadata in or out of the test.

    ``render._color_plan`` belongs in this list for the same reason the two

    it warm would let a test see Tissue colouring ARCHS4 in a state where the
    join does not exist. Every cache that stands downstream of an artifact this
    fixture hides has to be cleared here.
