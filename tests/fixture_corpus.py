"""Build a tiny, fully synthetic Bridge RNA corpus on disk.

The real corpus is a 963 MB memmap plus a multi-hour embedding job, so nothing
in the test suite may depend on it. This module manufactures a miniature but
*structurally identical* stand-in: the same file names, the same dtypes, the
same fixed global point order ([ARCHS4 ..., then OSDR ...]), and the same
sidecar schemas. Code that works against this fixture works against the real
artifacts, because the only difference is scale.

The synthetic embeddings are deliberately not random noise. Points are drawn
around a small number of latent cluster centers in 512-d, and the metadata
labels are generated *from* those clusters. That gives the render and color-by
tests real category structure to assert against: a category occupies a coherent
region of the projection, so a test can check that a palette assignment, a
legend count, or a viewport sample tracks real structure. A uniform-noise
fixture would make every one of those assertions vacuous.

The ARCHS4 half also gets a synthetic ``archs4_metadata.parquet`` whose source
strings are written in ARCHS4's free-text register ("liver", "whole blood",
"Brain cortex", "HeLa") and mapped through the *real* canonicalizer, so
``manifold/tissue.py`` is exercised against GEO-shaped strings rather than
against its own rule list.

Used by ``tests/conftest.py`` for the automated suite and by
``tests/build_dev_corpus.py`` to produce a browsable corpus for the running app.
