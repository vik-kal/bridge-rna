"""Prove, against the real corpus, that a retrieval marks the right points.

Deliberately not part of the pytest suite, and named so pytest does not collect
it. The suite runs against a synthetic fixture so it works on a machine with
neither the 963 MB memmap nor the multi-hour artifacts, and it already asserts
this contract there. This asserts it on the real 942,563-point corpus, where
the numbers are large enough that an off-by-one would be invisible by eye.

    /Users/josh/Bridge-RNA/.venv/bin/python tests/check_join.py [--sample KEY]

The claim under test is the one the whole merged app rests on, and it is
enforced by nothing but arithmetic:

  * an ARCHS4 hit's `archs4_index` is its row in the embedding memmap, and
    ARCHS4 occupies rows 0..n_archs4-1 of the map's global point order, so the
    row *is* the point;
  * an OSDR sample is the same `"<accession>|<sample name>"` key on both sides.

If either ever drifts, the map would keep drawing rings - just around the wrong
samples, confidently and silently. That is the failure this file exists to make
loud.
