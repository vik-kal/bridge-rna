"""End-to-end browser check of cohort retrieval, the way a user meets it.

A sibling of `e2e_check.py` and `e2e_upload_check.py`: same harness, same
deliberate exclusion from the pytest suite (which never touches the real
artifacts), and the same reason for existing. `tests/test_cohorts.py` proves the
estimator and the grouping against a synthetic corpus in a fraction of a second;
`precompute/validate_cohorts.py` proves the science against the real memmap.
Neither says whether a person can define a cohort, see how far to trust it, pool
it, compare two arms, and find the result on the map.

It asserts on what the page reports about itself, not on what the server meant
to send. The specific failures it was built to catch are in the checks below,
and two of them are already regressions this feature shipped and had fixed:
callbacks firing at page load so the canvas greeted a visitor with "Cohort
retrieval failed", and the legend continuing to advertise GSE nodes while a
two-cohort comparison that draws none was on screen.
