"""Figure construction and the sampling that feeds it.

The invariant these protect is the one that connects the picture to the data:
every drawn glyph must sit at the coordinates of the sample it depicts and carry
that sample's colour. A glyph drawn at the right pixel under the wrong label is
a silent lie, and on a 942,563-point scatter nobody would ever see it by eye.

Identity is checked by recomputing the sample indices and comparing coordinates,
rather than by reading them back out of ``customdata``. The ARCHS4 traces no
longer carry customdata at all: it existed to hand global indices to the lasso
readout, and with that gone it was roughly 600 KB of dead payload per figure.

    This is also the guard on a cut feature, which is the reason it now has a

    buildable the obvious way: `hoverinfo="skip"` suppresses click *picking* as
    well as hover, so the cloud emits no `plotly_click` at all, and the tempting
    fix is to turn hover back on. Measured in a real browser against the full
    942,563-point corpus, restyling these 13 traces to `hoverinfo="x+y"` makes
    them clickable and takes synchronous mousemove handling to a **median of
    239.8 ms, max 243.7 ms**, sustained rather than a one-time index build -
    which is a map that feels frozen under the cursor. `hoverinfo="none"` does
    not restore picking either.

    So if this test fails because someone enabled hover to make the cloud
    clickable, the fix is not to update the test. See
