"""Objective validation of the Phase 2/4 artifacts produced by build_projections.py.

Run this after every projection build. It exits nonzero on failure, so it can
gate a rebuild rather than relying on someone eyeballing a scatter plot.

Four groups of checks:

1. Structural - row counts agree across every artifact, coordinates are finite
   and non-degenerate, and the identity table lines up with the OSDR metadata it
   is joined to positionally.

2. Invariant 2 - PC1 must land well below the 57.8% recorded in REFERENCE.md
   section 4. That figure was measured *before* L2 normalization, where PC1 is
   the sequencing-depth axis. A normalized build must be far below it; landing
   near it is evidence normalization was silently skipped.

3. Cross-corpus mixing - how separated OSDR and ARCHS4 are in the 512-d space.
   This is the honesty check behind the app's whole premise. A raw "OSDR mostly
   neighbours OSDR" number conflates replicate structure with a technical batch
   effect, so the result is stratified by study and by tissue. Tissue is the
   dominant axis of variation in bulk expression, so OSDR samples that share
   neither study nor tissue but still neighbour each other cannot be explained
   by biology.

4. Projection quality - does the picture still stand for the 512-d space it was
   reduced from? Structural checks pass for any set of finite numbers, so they
   cannot tell a good projection from a scrambled one. This scores each
   coordinate set on local fidelity (are a point's 512-d neighbours still its
   neighbours on screen?) and on biological fidelity (do its neighbours share
   its tissue?), each against a null that says what the number would be if the
   map carried no information at all.

    python precompute/validate_artifacts.py             # structural + invariant
    python precompute/validate_artifacts.py --mixing    # also stream the memmap
    python precompute/validate_artifacts.py --quality   # also score the maps
    python precompute/validate_artifacts.py --quality --compare DIR

        # how a candidate build is compared against the shipped one.
